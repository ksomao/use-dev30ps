use-dev30ps

A Node.js module using webdev30ps as a dependency.

Installation

npm install use-dev30ps

Usage
const UseDev30ps = require('use-dev30ps');

const useDev30ps = new UseDev30ps();

The UseDev30ps class now includes a method fetchDataAndProcess that orchestrates fetching data from both the blockchain and an external API, combines and processes this data, writes it to a file, and then prints a timestamp.
combineAndProcessData is a stub for complex data processing logic. It currently combines the fetched data into a single object but can be expanded to include more elaborate processing based on the application's needs.
This setup demonstrates the use of asynchronous operations (async/await) for network requests, a common requirement in real-world applications dealing with external data sources.
Remember to replace 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY', '0xSomeEthereumAddressHere', and 'https://api.someexternaldata.com/data' with your actual Infura API key, Ethereum address, and external API URL.
